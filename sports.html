		<p>For me, sports are <em>theraputic</em>. They're a great outlet for relieving stress, and keep me fit and healthy. They're
		also great for meeting new people, and making friends. Some of my closest lifelong friends were met through playing
		sports, and some of my best memories were made through sports too. Pictured below are some of my favourite sports. </p>

			<p><b>Badminton:</b> Some of my earliest memories are playing badminton. We used to set up a net in our garden,
			and play with our next-door neighbors. I don't play much anymore, but it was the sport that sparked my passion
			for sports as a whole.</p>
			<br />
			<p><b>Soccer:</b> Soccer was the first sport I played with a club. I began playing for Avondale as a centre back, and played 
			for 4 years. I used to watch the champions league with my Dad every time it was on, so soccer is very nostalgic to me.
			I still kick the ball about with my friends for fun, but I don't play competitively anymore.</p>
			<br />
			<p><b>Swimming:</b> Swimming is my main source of exercise. I really enjoy it, and find it very peaceful. It's a really
			good workout, and the tranquility of being underwater is beautiful. I like to challenge myself every time I go swimming,
			and seeing my lung capacity increase over each session is really rewarding.</p>
			<br />
			<p><b>Pool:</b> Pool is my favorite sport to play with friends. There are pool tables in loads of pubs, and nothing beats
			having a few of the boys at the table, with a packet of Taytos in my left hand and a Beamish in my right. It's not exactly
			good for exercise, but it's a good bit of fun.</p>
