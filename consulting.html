			<p><strong>About Us:</strong></p>
			<p>Here at Pottinger Consulting Services, we care. We care about advancing technology, and more importantly, we
			care about you. We provide three different consulting services, each designed to help you achieve your goals. These
			services are Hyperautomation, Multiexperience, and Distributed Cloud. We hope we can be of your service.</p>

		<p><b> Hyperautomation: </b></p>
		</div>
		<div id="hyperautomationbody">
		<p> Hyperautomation permits organisations to automate more complex work. Gartner defines it as follows: </p>
		<p><i> "Hyperautomation deals with the application of advanced technologies including AI and machine learning
		to increasingly automate processes and augment humans.” </i></p>
		<p> We are excited about hyperautomation at Pottinger Consulting Services as it aligns to our vision of the
		future work, and how our customers are supplementing their tools. This more intelligent automation is required to tackle end-to-end
		processes where people interpret data, make decisions and produce predictions. Gartner views hyperautomation
		as an <i>“unavoidable market state”</i> as businesses must rapidly automate <i>“all possible businesses processes”</i> to 
		remain competitive, with several implications that further explain the Hyperautomation trend: The scope of 
		automation changes. We strive to help you utilize new artificial intelligence as easily as possible.</p>
		<p>We provide hyperautomation consultancy services to small businesses to help them maintain the competitive edge that they
		usually would be unable to achieve at a small scale. </p>

		<p><b> Multiexperience: </b></p>
		</div>
		<div id="multiexperiencebody">
		<p> MXDPs serve to centralize life cycle activities — designing, developing, testing, distributing, managing
		and analyzing — for a portfolio of multiexperience apps. Multiexperience refers to the various permutations of
		modalities (e.g., touch, voice and gesture), devices and apps that users interact with on their digital journey
		across the various touchpoints. </p>
		<p> As user application touchpoints increase in frequency, change in modalities and expand in device type, 
		the future of app development is multiexperience, according to a recent survey by Gartner, Inc. </p>
		<p><i> Mobile apps are projected to have the most impact on business success by 2020 </i></p>
		<p> </p>
		<p> The top barrier to building compelling multiexperience applications is the need for business and IT alignment.
		This is where we can help. We provide an excellent and easy-to-use multiexperience consultancy service, which 
		will help your business expand your reach to various new technologies</p>

		<div id="distributedcloudbody">
		<p> This is the distribution of public cloud services to different locations while the originating public
		cloud provider assumes responsibility for the operation, governance, updates to and evolution of the services.
		According to industry analyst Gartner's report, this represents a significant shift from the centralized model
		of most public cloud services and will lead to a new era in cloud computing. </p>
		<p>A distributed cloud means that the computation, storage, and networking are in a micro-cloud located outside
		the centralized cloud. The distributed cloud is closer to the end-user as a decentralized cloud system. </p>
		<p> Here at PCS, we plan to provide you with consulting about Distributed Cloud frameworks. We believe it is 
		an asset to any modern business, and will help free up resources and give <i>your business</i> a competitive edge.</p>
